# export TF_VAR_nobl9_client_id="<your Nobl9 Client ID>"
# export TF_VAR_nobl9_client_secret="<your Nobl9 Client Secret>"
# or using separate secret.tfvars file for them and ensure it is not checked out in the repository,
# you can read more about there https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables.

# (Please note that you may suppress installation of an electrode if you already have it in-cluster, and in that case
# you can leave it enabled here, assuming it provides the prerequisite metrics.)
